<b>U-Seal self Mailer:</b>
U-Seal is a revolutionary new concept in self-seal mailing applications. Though similar to pressure seal in using Z, C and V fold sequences, U-Seal requires only 10# of pressure to create a bond. This means you can literally hand seal your mailer. No offline equipment is necessary with minimal sealing pressure required. 

Opening the document can be accomplished by peeling the document apart; therefore you do not loose any print territory to tear off margins.

They are an efficient way of getting valuable marketing messages in both images and text directly into the hands of potential customers. Brochures allow customers to quickly get a feel for products or services, while also finding answers to many of their initial questions. Brochures are great to include in a sales kit or pass out in high-traffic areas.

The most common order option is 11" x 8.5" before folding on 100# Gloss Text paper. Almost always, brochures are printed full color on both sides (4/4) and are coated AQ 2 sides. The most common folds are Tri-Folds, Z-Folds, and Half-Folds. Tri-Folds and Z-Folds give you 6 panels to display your information. Half-Folds give you 4 panels.
